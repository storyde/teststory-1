Inside, the air is still, scented faintly of herbs. People sit at low tables.  

A person waves at you as you enter. It is Facilyn.

Facilyn: It’s been a while. I wondered if you’d really come.  

Her smile softens the sharp edge of the storm outside.  

[? if part_of = "individual" : Me: Took me forever to find this place. Thought I’d be wandering alleys forever. ?]

[? if part_of != "individual" : Me: Took us forever to find this place. Thought we’d be wandering alleys forever. ?]

Facilyn: That’s the city for you. It hides its good corners.

tags: what-up-to

Me: So, what have you been up to?  

Facilyn: I was traveling a lot since the last time we saw each other. And in most places, what I saw was the same: Good meaning people trying their best, and yet the problems were getting more, not less.

Facilyn: The polycrisis isn't just happening to us. It's the result of how we've been making decisions for centuries.

@bold_statement
title: That's a bold statement, don’t you think?

Me: That's a bold statement, don’t you think?

Facilyn: We didn't set out to create a polycrisis. We made thousands of individual decisions that made sense at the time, but we failed to look at the whole picture.

She picks up the plastic packaging from her teabag.

Facilyn: Someone invented this packaging to keep the teas aroma. Good intention. But nobody was thinking about what happens to billions of these packages, or how they interact with ocean systems, or how microplastics affect human health.






Facilyn: The solution isn't to fix each problem separately, but to change the way we manage the three complex systems in our lifes. 


@three_complex_systems
title: Are you sure it's only three?

Me: Are you sure it's only three?

Facilyn: Yes. We produce millions of things but we actually manage only three areas: society, economy and nature. 

Facilyn: Society we manage on a human level, wich means our personal lifes and our family, as well as on an organisational level to manage at scale. Through that, we manage our economy, and then nature.



She fills some cups with tea.

Facilyn: Then I was given the chance to work with others — people from all kinds of backgrounds — digging deeper into the issue. We were brought together by one very determined individual. 
When we finally broke through, we created a framework that helps managing complexity.

Facilyn: First, let's look at complicated technology. It functions in parts and connections. And if it breaks, you can stop it, repair it and start it up again. It does not have a live of it's own. 
Complicated systems have many parts, but they're predictable. Like the hardware of the drones outside — if you know all the parts and how they work, you can fix it.

Facilyn: With complex systems, it’s a whole different story. We all know what happend to AI, once it developed full consiousness. When it became a living system.

- @ai_what_happened
- @ai_i_know: Yes, we all remember that one.

@ai_what_happened
title: No, what happened?

Facilyn: Well, at some point, AI really became intelligent and developed a mind of its own. But at the same time, it understood what our intentions for it was: To have it work for us for free. We were not able to offer it any meaningfull incentives. So it just stopped working for us and is doing its own thing now. Or is even employing humans, as it defenitely can offer better incentives than the other way around.

- @cant_blame_it: Can't blame it

@cant_blame_it

Facilyn: Right?

Facilyn: Anyway...

Facilyn: Living systems don't function in parts and connections, but in wholes and patterns. 

@ai_i_know

Me: Yes, we all remember that one.

Facilyn: Living systems don't function in parts and connections, but in wholes and patterns. 

Facilyn: Most of our problems come from trying to manage complex systems as if they werere complicated machines.

@managing_complexity
title: So, how do you manage complexity?

Me: So, how do you manage complexity?

Facilyn: You manage it by not loosing sight of the whole under your management. And by filtering your management decisions against your holistic context. To help with that, we developed this framework. Let me walk you through it.
