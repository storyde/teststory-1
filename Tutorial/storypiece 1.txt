= In a time not so far into the future…

Society battles with the symptoms of the *polycrises*, staggering under the weight of interconnected challenges. Streets crack under inequality. Climate trembles. Trust fades.

You—an explorer by nature, or perhaps just someone who got curious one day—arrive in the middle of it all. A solar-charged wristpad beeps. The air smells like static and regret.

You mutter to yourself as you stumble through a half-deserted plaza, looking for shelter. A local info-hub flickers, offering outdated alerts about riots and drought.

A street vendor nearby offers water for crypto. You hand over your last bit. It tastes metallic.

A dust storm looms. You're stuck—alone, confused, slowly beginning to grasp what *polycrisis* really means.

= What is the Polycrisis?

A polycrisis is when many crises—economic, ecological, social—converge and compound each other. One crisis amplifies another. Unstable politics worsen inequality. Soil degradation weakens food systems. Trust erodes. Everything is connected.

You watch a child draw on cracked pavement: a house, a river, a family. The dust blows it all away.

@humanmade
title: Cause or Consequence?

Some blame nature. Others point at humanity. Looking around—the failing infrastructure, the gated communities, the dead wetlands—you feel a tug in your gut.

Yes. This was made. Decision by decision. System by system.

You venture forward. Above, surveillance drones buzz softly. A mural reads: “We Had the Tools.”

Someone stands in the shadow of an old community center. Hooded, quiet. A screen on their arm glows blue.

*Facilitator*: "You look like someone asking better questions. Walk with me. Let’s begin again."

- @complexity_q: "What do you mean by another way?"

You see delivery bots stuck in potholes. Advertisements project onto broken windows. Kids sell purifiers made from old tech parts. A farmer pleads with drones overhead.

This is not just poverty. It’s managed collapse.

- @complexity_q: What is complexity?

= What is Complexity?

Living systems—like nature, societies, economies—are *complex* and *self-organizing*. You can’t pause them. You can’t fix them like you’d fix a broken phone.

They adapt, evolve, surprise.

= Management vs Production

Production is mechanical: break, fix, resume.

Management of complexity? That’s surgery on a living patient while the patient runs a marathon. You manage as you go. You adapt constantly.

*Facilitator*: “Let me show you something different. A way to manage complexity holistically.”

They hand you an old datapad. The title blinks: *Holistic Context Builder.*

= Step 0: Are you acting for yourself or an organization?

- @step1: “As part of an organization”
- @step2: “Only me / my family”

# Remaining scenes follow unchanged, but consider enriching their tone similarly.

# Add visual details, emotional reflections, and cultural quirks.
# Add a rival perspective or critical voice later in the game for contrast.

# Ending scene already reflects the tone well; optionally expand facilitator's arc.

*Facilitator* (smiling faintly): “Your civilization won’t be saved by algorithms or ideology alone. Living systems will always surprise us. But now—you have a compass.”

They pause.

“Assume you’re wrong. Monitor closely. Re-plan. Resilience isn't certainty—it's readiness.”
