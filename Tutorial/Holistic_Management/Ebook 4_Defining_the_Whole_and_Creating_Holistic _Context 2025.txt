Introduction

The holistic context is fundamental to the man-agement of anything complex, as any agricul-tural endeavor is, and will guide the decisions and actions you take to achieve your goals and objectives. That’s why the utmost consideration should be given to creating one. The first step is to define the whole your management encom-passes to clarify the boundaries of what you are managing and to identify the people who will create the holistic context.





Wholes within wholes: We exist as a part of a larger whole, as well as others that overlap and interconnect with other wholes.

DEFINING THE WHOLE: WHAT ARE YOU MANAGING?

Knowing who and what your “whole” includes helps you determine who makes decisions, who influences the decisions made, and it helps put boundaries around what you can and cannot manage through your planning and decision making.

Remember, the first principle to understanding holistic planning and decision making is recog-nizing that the world operates in wholes. The first key insight that led to the development of Holistic Management is that a holistic perspec-tive is essential in management. So the first step is defining the whole you are managing. To be manageable a whole should identify these three aspects:

The people directly involved in your manage-ment and making decisions;

The resources available to you—physical assets, as well as people who can assist, influence, or be influenced by your management; and,

The money on hand, or that you can generate.

Defining the whole does more than just help you put boundaries round your planning and decision making. It reminds you of the various resources available that you can utilize for making better management decisions. Lastly, this exercise can make you further aware of the various wholes influencing the whole you are managing and, in turn, how you influence them.

Defining the whole, then, will involve identifying the decision makers, the resource base, and the money you have available or can generate.

The Decision Makers

These are the people who will create the holistic context. They should include all the people mak-ing day-to-day management decisions within the entity you are managing. Make a list of them, trying to be inclusive rather than exclusive. If they don’t participate they are less likely to buy in to the holistic context and thus to make de-cisions aligned with it. If there are people who, while not making decisions can veto them or derail any decisions made without their input or agreement, include them too.

Be prepared to redefine this part of the whole if you later realize that people who should have been included in creating the holistic context were left out. Excluding even minor decision makers can lead to problems down the road.





**Money**





**Decision ****makers**





**Resource ****Base**





The Resource Base

**Physical ****Resources:** Next, list the major physical resources from which you can generate revenue or derive support: the land \(including livestock and wildlife\), the factory and its machinery, the office building, your home, or whatever is rele-vant in your case. These resources need not be owned, merely available to you. You are not af-ter a detailed list of every asset you have, only a very general one. You may later decide to sell some of the assets you own anyway, particularly the liquid or movable ones.1

**Human ****Resources:** Now make a list of the cat-egories of people who can/will influence or be influenced by the management decisions you make, but won’t have the power to veto or alter them—clients and customers, suppliers, advi-sors, neighbors, family, and so on. These people are no less important than the decision makers included in the first part of your whole. In fact, they are often vitally important to the whole even though they do not make management decisions within it. You wouldn’t be in business without the clients or customers who buy your products, for instance. 





1 Some organizations or agencies, such as those managing a wildlife preserve or conservation area, may have a need to include a more detailed list of “ecological assets,” but for most others this is not necessary. 





p.5





Be inclusive. Some groups or organizations you consider adversarial may in fact be an important part of your resource base, as you may need to work with them to move forward productively. If the entity you are managing includes some-thing as large and complex as state lands or a national park, the people in your resource base could number in the millions. To overcome the dilemma of how to include them all, list groups of people representative of the larger public—for example, environmental groups, community or-ganizations and others deeply concerned about how that land or wildlife is managed. 

Occasionally, it may be difficult to determine whether some people fall in the first part of the whole, as decision makers who will create the holistic context, or the second part—as resourc-es to you in achieving your goals. This is an easy mistake to make when the people concerned aren’t involved in day-to-day management, yet can veto some of your decisions. If they are not daily decision makers, but have considerable influence over specific management decisions, they belong in the resource base. But, be sure to note their influence and to remember them when making decisions that will be of concern to them. An example of someone who has influ-ence, but does not make management decisions would be the loan officer responsible for your line of credit at the bank.

the Money 

Money could be listed in your resource base but it is considered separately in describing the whole so that you can note all the sources avail-able to you. This could include cash on hand, money in a savings account or available from friends and family, a line of credit at the bank, or crowd sourcing, etc. And it would almost al-ways include money that could be generated from the physical assets listed in your resource base. Don’t be sidetracked here by long and in-volved discussions on the meaning of money and wealth. Just think of money in terms of what 





you require to live on, or to run the business, in-stitute, agency, or whatever entity you are deal-ing with.

Keep Your Focus on the Big Picture

In defining the whole, keep your lists and notes brief. Great detail is not needed now, only big-picture clarity. Below is a selection of exam-ples. In each case a person, or group of people, have identified an entity they want to manage holistically—their lives, a business, an agency, and so on. Now they’re ready to determine what the minimum, manageable, whole would be:

A single, employed person seeking to manage her life holistically would conclude that there is only one person making decisions—herself. Her resource base includes her home, her job and work associates, her friends, neighbors, and mentors \(many of these people would be named\). Actually, any number of people could be regarded as resources for her. For money, she would have what she earns and can save or invest profitably. 

A family seeking to manage a farm holistical-ly might say that the decision makers include the members of their immediate family and their two employees. Their resource base includes the land they own, plus the 200 acres they lease, the wildlife that live on their land, their home, their equipment, their ex-tended family in town, their customers, their suppliers, the county extension agent, their soil testing laboratory, and their local study group. For money, they have only what they can earn from the farm.

Members of a livestock marketing cooper-ative in an African community seeking to manage their cooperative, or coop, holisti-cally might say the decision makers are the coop members. Their resource base includes the land within the community boundaries, plus the grazing lands they share with other communities, their livestock, and their sale 





p.6





pens, their customers \(those who buy their livestock\), their marketing advisors, veteri-nary suppliers, government inspectors and extension agents. They have the money they can earn from livestock sales, or that extend-ed family members can loan to the coop.

Don’t worry that you won’t “get it right.” You will have plenty of opportunities to fur-ther refine it. The result, no matter how rough, should be adequate to enable you to get on with creating your holistic context. As you work at refining your holistic context you may need to reconsider your whole as well.

Creating Your Holistic Context

Often when we reach our goals we later find it has been at the expense of long-term factors we failed to consider. Inevitably, each goal was made within a context that was too narrow, giv-en the complexity of situations where human values, livelihoods, and our life-sustaining en-vironment intersect. Defining one all-embrac-ing *holistic* context for your goals in the whole you are managing is a new concept. Where the context for our goals and actions may once have been focused on immediate needs, desires, or 





a problem, the holistic context shifts the focus beyond them to a conscious awareness of the life we want to lead and the life-supporting en-vironment and behaviors that help ensure it. You will find that in framing your management and decision making within a holistic context things rapidly change for the better because many of the problems we face are really symptoms re-sulting from the unintended consequences flow-ing from past management. 

The holistic context has two essential components: *quality **of **life*—how we want our lives to be within the whole we manage; and, *future **resource **base*—a description of the environment and behaviors that will sustain that quality of life for future generations. If the whole under management includes an orga-nization formed for a specific purpose we create a *statement **of **purpose* beforehand. 

Creating a Statement of Purpose: Why Were We Formed? 

If you are managing an organization or a divi-sion within one that was formed for a specific purpose your holistic context needs to reflect that purpose. \(A family farm may not fit in this category, but a land management agency cer-tainly would.\) In stating this purpose, you want to get to the heart of the matter. The statement should reflect, in very few words, what the orga-nization was formed to do. It shouldn’t take more than a sentence or two. If it does, then you have probably gone beyond a statement of purpose into *how* you see yourselves doing whatever it is you are supposed to do. For example, a farm cooperative may describe its purpose this way:-*To **provide **business **services, **access **to **markets, **and **research **information **to **our **members.*

The statement of purpose helps ensure that the holistic context speaks to the reason for the entity’s existence and that the goals, plans and actions you engage in are in keeping with this purpose. Revisit your statement of purpose pe-riodically, just to make sure that the purpose for which you were formed continues to be relevant.





p.7





Quality of Life Statement

In creating this first part of your holistic con-text describe *how **you **want **your **life **to **be* in the whole you have defined, based on what you most value. It should express why you’re do-ing what you’re doing, what you are about, and what you want to become. It is a reflection of what motivates and excites you. It is your collec-tive sense of what is important and why. 

There are four areas you may want to consider in thinking about quality of life: economic well-be-ing, relationships, challenge and growth, and purpose and contribution.

**Economic ****Well-Being: **This is essential for meeting basic human needs for food, clothing, shelter, health, and security. The entity as a whole must be prosperous, but so should the individuals within it. Get to the heart of the matter. “Making a lot of money” is rarely as useful in a quality of life statement as naming instead what you gain from having money: economic security, comfortable surroundings, enough to eat, and the wherewithal to do what you want to do. The same can be said for any material object.





**Relationships: **Mention qualities such as harmony, clear and open communication, good teamwork, and so on. These qualities, if not already present, will only come about through changes in behavior, which you will address in the next part of your holistic context. For this reason, in your quality of life statement *describe **the **kind **of **relationships **that **result **from **respectful, **caring **behavior, **rather **than **the **behavior **itself*. For example, you might say: “We work as a team that communicates effectively, remains calm under pressure and has fun together.”

**Challenge ****and ****Growth: **Where is the challenge in what you do? Try to think in terms of what you find stimulating, what requires all the resourcefulness and creativity you can muster? What sort of working environment stimulates creativity and allows you to be all you can be?

**Purpose ****and ****Contribution: **Ask yourselves three important questions:

What are we about?

What do we want to be?

What do we ultimately want to accomplish?

The answers will help you discover the meaning in what you are doing. If you are working within an organization guided by a statement of pur-pose, you have an answer to the first question of what you are about. Your answers to the re-maining questions help all the decision makers find meaning and personal relevance in the pur-pose and increase commitment to meeting it.

Some statements are simple, others more elab-orate. What matters, is that they represent what is most important to you and that all decision makers in the whole see their thoughts reflected in the end product. It will be important to discuss what certain statements mean and to be sure that all the decision makers share the same un-derstanding. For example, what does it mean to be “financially secure”? Are all decision makers in agreement on this?





p.8





In recording everyone’s thoughts initially, it is im-portant that you capture them in simple phras-es, rather than well-worded sentences. You will have plenty of time to edit the results into a uni-fied statement. And you will refine your quality of life statement over time.

Future Resource Base Description

Describe your future resource base as it must be if it is to sustain the quality of life you desire. There are two elements to consider: the *people* you included in the resource base when defining your whole and the *land, **or **environment*, even if you did not make reference to it when defining your whole and even when you operate a busi-ness that has no direct connection to the land.

**The ****People: **How will you have to behave to ensure the people in your resource base \(customers, clients, suppliers, extended family, etc.\) continue to support you? Consider each of the people or groups of people mentioned in your resource base. For your clients, people whose loyalty and patronage you want to maintain, you might describe yourselves as “honest, professional, prompt, reliable, producing nothing but the best quality, environmentally-responsible,” and so on. Developing your list is not difficult to do if you just try to think from their point of view. Finally, review your quality of life statement to make sure the behaviors underlying the relationships you desire among yourselves, as decision makers, are covered, too.

**The ****Land: **When you are managing land, you need to provide a fairly detailed description of what that land must look like far into the future. Describe it in terms of the four ecosystem processes—water and mineral cycles, community dynamics and energy flow \(see ebook \#2\)—not as they now are functioning, but as they will have to be functioning in the future if you are to sustain the quality of life you have described over many generations. For example:





“Many generations hence, our land will be healthy and rich in biological diversity. Soils will be covered throughout the year, and remain where they form. Streams will flow perennially and clear and be healthy enough to drink from. Water and mineral cycles will be maximized and energy flow optimized for all life forms.”

Even when you are not managing land, it is im-portant to describe the land surrounding you as it must be far into the future. Some people hesitate to do so, feeling they don’t know enough about it. But one doesn’t need a scientific background to be able to express a need for surroundings that are stable, productive and healthy, with clean and clear-running rivers, and covered—rather than bare—soils. And this would be enough of a description for checking to ensure your deci-sions in line with your holistic context.

Once you have thought through and described all the elements that make up your future re-source base, you will have a holistic context.

Drafting Your Holistic Context

Now that you know more about the holistic con-text, it’s your turn to create one. Bear in mind the guidelines that follow. Use the worksheet on this page to define your whole. And then, with the other decision makers in your whole, use the worksheet on the next page to create your holistic context \(statement of purpose, if need-ed, quality of life statement, and future resource base description\).

Guidelines for Creating Your Holistic context

The decision makers identified in the whole should create the holistic context, and they in-clude anyone making management decisions at any level, or having veto power over them.

A trained facilitator can help bring out beliefs and aspirations that might otherwise not be voiced and can be invaluable in keeping the group fo-cused on the task at hand. 

Write out the holistic context so all can see it. 





Worksheet for DeFINing Your Whole Under Management

**Who ****are ****the ****decision ****makers ****now?**

Who makes the decisions?

Who has veto power?

**What ****resources ****do ****you ****have ****now?**

Physical resources \(including land and other assets from which you derive revenue/sup-port\)

Human resources \(people who can/will influ-ence or be influenced by your management\)

**What ****money ****is ****available?**





Keep its length to a page or less so all can remember it.

Don’t worry about getting it perfect, you will refine it over time.

Make sure the words used mean the same thing to each person.

Don’t prioritize the ideas expressed—noth-ing is more important than anything else.

Don’t include actions or any prejudice against a future action.

Include what you are for, not what you are against.

Don’t refer to problems, only to what lies be-yond them.

A holistic context that has meaning for all the decision makers involved is one they will commit to. The more ownership they have in it, the more likely everyone will be to act within it.

HOLISTIC CONTEXT = HOLTEXT

The abbreviation for holistic context is *holtext*, never *context* on its own, which risks confusion of meaning.
