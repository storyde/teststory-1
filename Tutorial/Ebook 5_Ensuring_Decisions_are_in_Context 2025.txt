Introduction

Up to this point this series of ebooks has con-centrated on the framework that guides Holistic Management: identification of the whole to be managed; creation of the holistic context \(ebook \#4\); the four ecosystem processes that serve as the foundation for all human endeavor and on which the holistic context rests \(ebook \#2\); the tools for managing those ecosystem process-es and the different effects some of those tools produce in brittle and nonbrittle environments \(ebook \#3\). Now you are ready to begin mak-ing management decisions using your holistic context as a guide to ensure that you never lose sight of what is most meaningful to you in both the short and long term.

As you move forward with management you will develop plans that include goals and objec-tives and the tactics, strategies and policies for achieving them. Some of those goals and objec-tives will include *what **you **plan **to **do **to **create **the **quality **of **life **your **holistic **context **describes **and **the **environment **and **behaviors **that **will **sustain **it **and, **if **an **organization, **to **meet **your **stated **purpose*. The tactics, strategies and pol-icies that help you achieve these and any other goals and objectives will come down to actions and those actions need to be checked to ensure they are aligned with your holistic context.

The Context Checks

Informed by your awareness of the four key in-sights, the ecosystem processes and their man-agement, and the inspiration of your holistic con-text, you decide which tools to use and actions to take to achieve your goals and objectives. As al-ways, you consider past experience, expert advice, research results, expediency, cost, cash flow, profit-ability, laws and regulations, and so on. In addition, you may consult the management guidelines, \(cov-ered in detail in chapters 32 through 37 of *Holistic **Management, **Third **Edition*\) before deciding how best to apply a tool or carry out an action.





Now, before taking any action you run it through seven basic checks that consider the social, eco-nomic and environmental impacts that may flow from that action relative to your holistic context. Your aim is to avoid actions that appear econom-ically sound, but at the expense of the environ-ment or the well being of people, or that are en-vironmentally sound, but hopelessly uneconom-ic or damaging to human welfare. Above all, you want to avoid actions that, while they achieve your objective, are likely to produce undesirable consequences down the road.

THE SEVEN CONTEXT CHECKS

*Cause **and **effect.* Does this action address the root cause of the problem?

*Weak **link.*

*Social:* Could this action, due to prevailing atti-tudes or beliefs, create a weak link between us and those whose support we need? 

*Biological:* Does this action address the weak-est link in the life cycle of this organism?

*Financial:* Does this action strengthen the weakest link in the chain of production?

*Marginal **reaction.* Which action provides the greatest return toward the goal for each additional unit of time or money invested?

*Gross **profit **analysis.* Which enterprises contribute the most to covering the overheads of the business?

*Energy/money **source **and **use.* Is the ener-gy or money to be used in this action derived from the most appropriate source in terms of our holistic context? Will the way in which the energy or money is used be in line with our holistic context?

*Sustainability.* If we take this action, will it lead toward or away from the future resource base described in our holistic context?

*Gut **feel.* How do we feel about this action now? Will it lead to the quality of life we desire? Will it adversely affect the lives of others?





p.4





Each of the context checks are condensed into one or two questions you ask yourself prior to taking action. Some checks will not apply to cer-tain actions, and can be skipped. Some checks will raise points you will again consider in other checks. The checking should take you minutes, rather than hours. Once you are more familiar with the checks and have internalized the ques-tions, the checking will take you seconds and will become something you begin to do subcon-sciously.

The Checking Process

When asked and answered in quick succes-sion, the checking questions enable you to see the likely effect of any action on the whole you manage. Avoid dwelling on any one check to the point that you lose sight of the picture formed by scanning them all. 

If the action passes most or all of the checks that apply, you should feel fairly confident in implementing it. If it fails one or more checks, you have several options:

you may want to modify how you imple-ment the action \(or apply the tool\),

abandon it altogether, or, 

in some cases, go ahead anyway knowing that sooner or later you will have to deal with the reasons it didn’t pass. 

There are no rules on the order in which to ask these questions, except one: the Gut Feel check should always be last. Your answers to the questions asked in this check should reflect the impression gained after passing through all the others. As you become more familiar with the background information associated with each check you will automatically tend to or-der the checking according to the nature of the action being checked. If the action addresses a problem, for instance, you will tend to go to the cause and effect check first. If you fail this check, it is often pointless to continue. 





Before long, you will instinctively know which checks apply to any action and which ones you can skip. Likewise, there will be times when your common sense tells you that, in light of your holistic context, a certain action is going to fail most of the checks, and you will modify it before going further. 

Speed is Essential

As mentioned at the outset, speed is essential to the checking process. If you can’t quickly an-swer “yes” or “no” to a question, simply bypass the check and move on to the next one. If you can’t reach a conclusion after passing through all the other checks, then come back to the one or two you bypassed so you can give them more consideration. In most cases, you have bypassed a check because you don’t have enough infor-mation to know whether the action passed or failed it. You may, for example, need to take time to diagnose the cause of a problem before you can answer the question asked in the cause and effect check. Or, you may need to gather actual figures, rather than estimates, for a gross prof-it analysis before you can pass this check with confidence. Once you have the needed informa-tion, run the action through the checks again and make a final judgment.

Don’t worry that the speed of the checking will lead to an unsatisfactory result. You will be mon-itoring your actions to ensure they in fact achieve what you plan to achieve, and replan—and re-check—any time you veer off track. When an ac-tion involves an attempt to alter ecosystem pro-cesses in any way, you assume at the outset that, because it is impossible to account for nature’s inherent complexity, the action, *even **though **it **passes **all **of **the **checks*, could be wrong. On the assumption you are wrong, you determine the criteria you should monitor to give you the ear-liest possible warning of a need to replan. We’ll come back to this subject, once we’ve covered all seven checks. 





p.5





Cause and Effect

The cause and effect check carries considerable weight when taking action to address a prob-lem. It enables you to winnow out actions that only suppress symptoms when you need to cor-rect the cause.

The question you ask is: “Does this action address the root cause of the problem?” 

This check helps you avoid a recurrence of the problem by first asking you to think carefully about what might be causing it. If the action under con-sideration addresses that cause then it passes this check. All too often we tend to address the symp-toms spawned by a deeper underlying cause be-cause the problem \(symptom\) is always visible. When cockroaches appear in the kitchen, we spray them first and then only sometimes ask what has caused them to show up in the first place. Quick fixes, such as spraying a pesticide, that tackle symptoms are very attractive, because they often remove the symptom right away, but they can also produce unintended consequences. In the case of the roach spraying, the poison used can harm roach predators that help keep roach numbers in check, as well as the people using the kitchen. And if the cause of the roaches’ presence isn’t ad-dressed \(keeping surfaces clean, sealing off entry points, etc.\), the roaches \(and the problem\) return.

If the problem persists or returns, you haven’t addressed the cause.

Identifying the Cause

Identifying the cause of a problem can be fairly easy, but it can also require considerable prob-ing. In most situations, this is a relatively unstruc-tured exercise. You merely pose and answer the same questions over and over again: What is 





the cause of this? and when you have your an-swer, Well, what is the cause of that? You may have to ask this question three or four or more times, peeling away layers of symptoms, before you find the cause you should address.

If the problem concerns land or natural resource management \(e.g., soil erosion, a plague of grasshoppers, increase in brush or weeds, or a decrease in the number of snow geese\) look first to the four ecosystem processes for an answer. Then consider the tools \(covered in ebook \#3\) that may have been used in the past. How they have been applied, and the degree of brittle-ness, will affect how the ecosystem processes are functioning now.

In general, the cause and effect check warns you to not implement an action unless you feel sure it addresses the cause of a problem, rather than its effects or symptoms. In an emergency you may proceed, but only in full knowledge of the dan-gers and only to buy time to rectify the cause.

Weak Link

A chain stretched to breaking will, by definition, fail at the weakest link. At any moment in time every chain has one, and only one, weakest link that alone accounts for the strength of the entire chain, regardless of how strong other links might be. To strengthen a chain when resources are lim-ited, one must always attend first to the weakest link. Other links, no matter how frail they appear, are nonproblems until the weakest link is fixed. 

An undetected weak link can cause important undertakings to fail or to suffer from continual setbacks. Thus the weak link check helps ensure that your actions address the link that is weakest at any moment. The check applies in three differ-ent situations: social, biological, and financial.

Social Weak Link

You, and the future you envision for the whole under your management, are linked by a chain made up of all the actions you will take to get 





p.6





there. Any action that runs counter to prevailing attitudes and beliefs is likely to meet with resis-tance, creating a blockage that, if not addressed, will at some point become a weak link between you and the people whose support for your ef-forts is important, even vital.

The question you ask is: “Could this action, due to prevailing attitudes or beliefs, create a weak link between us and those whose support we need?”

If such a potential weak link is identified then it’s important that you address it before you take ac-tion. Thus this question is not asking simply for a yes or no response but reminding you to address a potential social weak link before it becomes one. You want to ensure that as you move forward you do not inadvertently create disagreements that could have been avoided, or conflict or resistance that later hinders your progress.

Biological Weak Link

In the biological context, the weak link check ap-plies when you are dealing with populations of plant or animal organisms that have become a problem, either because they are too many or too few in number: the parasites infesting the farm-er’s sheep, the loco weed that invades the range, or the tortoise or owl threatened with extinction. 

The question you ask is: “Does this action address the weakest point in the life cycle of this organism?” 

Before we take any action to increase or de-crease their numbers, we need first to ensure that it addresses the weakest link in the organ-ism’s life cycle. In doing so, we are likely to max-imize the effectiveness of the action and to en-sure the results will be lasting.





Every organism has a point of greatest vul-nerability during its life cycle—a weakest link. Recognize this and you increase your ability to effectively decrease or increase that species’ ability to recruit new members to its population. When action you are contemplating addresses that weak link, it passes this check.

Financial Weak Link

Each year in conjunction with Holistic Financial Planning \(see ebooks \#6 and \#7\) you need to identify the weak link in the chain of production that stretches from the raw resources you work with to the money you receive for the products produced in each business enterprise. This chain has three links to which human creativity is ap-plied: *resource **conversion, **product **conversion, *and* **marketing **\(or **money **conversion\)*.

The question you ask is: “Does this action address the weakest link in the chain of production?” 

In an agricultural business you are using human cre-ativity and money to convert sunlight energy, the re-source link, through plants into a saleable or consum-able form. In the product conversion link, you turn the plants grown in the first link into a marketable form, commonly crops, livestock, or wildlife. In the market-ing \(or money conversion\) link the products of the second link are marketed, and money is finally derived from the sunlight captured in the first link.

When strengthening the chain of production re-quires money, and profit is a goal, the proposed investments should pass the weak link check \(by addressing the identified weakest link\). Increas-ing investment in advertising \(marketing link\) will not profit a business that turns out a poor product \(product conversion link\) as much as improving that product would do. Only investment in the weak link will result in more profit at the end.





p.7





Marginal Reaction

The marginal reaction check only applies when you are considering two or more actions that have passed the other checks.

The question you ask is: “Which action will provide the greatest return toward the goal for each additional unit of money or time invested?”

In other words, which action gets the “biggest bang for the buck?” No two actions can possi-bly give you the same return for each unit of ef-fort \(money or time\) invested at that moment. So when resources are limited, you want to select the one from which you gain the most. In doing so you will end up spending less time or money, and achieve what you want more quickly.

In Holistic Financial Planning, you can use this check in conjunction with the weak link \(finan-cial\) check to prioritize the actions you take to strengthen the weak link in your chain of produc-tion. It also helps you prioritize the time you spend on each endeavor. Since time is a finite resource, you want to make sure you maximize the return on every hour you spend.

In the end, however, this check is always a sub-jective one. It has to be, because you are com-paring two or more actions that have passed the other context checks and selecting the one that

yields the highest return per dollar or human hour invested in situations often difficult to quantify.

Gross Profit Analysis

The gross profit analysis check is mainly used in Holistic Financial Planning to help select those enterprises \(products or services from which you derive income\) that, after associated costs and risks have been factored in, produce the most income. The income from these enterprises has to cover your overhead costs and generate some excess for there to be any profit. 

The question you ask is: “Which enterprises contribute the most to covering the overheads of the business?” 

In the gross profit analysis check you simply look at the income likely to be derived from each en-terprise and deduct the “additional money” you will have to spend to bring in that income. *The **difference **between **money **in **and **money **out **is **the **gross **profit*. The additional money to be spent is that money you would not spend un-less you undertook the enterprise. Through the analysis and comparison of many possible en-terprises with this check, you are selecting the best enterprise, or combination of enterprises, to create profit and minimize risk.

While this check does not account for anything but money earned and spent, the technique still throws fresh light on many situations, and other context checks will help ensure other factors are considered in making your final enterprise selec-tions. The ideal is to find the best enterprise or combination of enterprises in which all the tech-nology and other tools pass all checks. It is the only check that requires the use of pencil and paper, and is somewhat more time consuming than the others. When considering new enter-prises for your business, it is time well spent.





p.8





Energy/Money Source and Use

While the gross profit analysis check helps you select enterprises based on profitability, there are other factors to consider. Not only the en-terprise itself, but also the secondary inputs that support it, must pass the other checks that ap-ply. This check examines both the sources and patterns of use of the energy and money used in production. We lump money and energy to-gether because any action contemplated usually requires one or the other, and often both. 

The questions you ask are: “Is the energy or money to be used in this action derived from the most appropriate source in terms of our holistic context? Will the way in which the energy or money is used be in line with our holistic context?”

This check helps you avoid:

actions likely to lead you into an increasing dependency on, or addiction to, fossil fuels or any other inputs; and

actions involving an addictive use of bor-rowed money on which you are paying com-pound interest.

Sources of Energy

In terms of availability, energy sources fall into two categories: those that are abundant or un-limited, and those that are limited in supply. Solar energy that is used to grow the farmer’s crops is unlimited and virtually inexhaustible; but the die-sel used to fuel the farm machinery is not. We will eventually run out of secure and affordable supplies of all fossil fuels.

In terms of their effects on the environment, en-ergy sources fall into three categories: benign, damaging, or potentially damaging. When you choose to walk or ride a bicycle instead of driv-





ing your car, you are choosing a more benign source of energy rather than a potentially more damaging one. So is a farmer who uses livestock to break down corn stubble in a field rather than using some type of machinery. Keeping in mind your holistic context, determine whether the source of energy you plan to use in taking an ac-tion is appropriate in your present situation.

Sources of Money

Money used to implement any action can be de-rived from either internal or external sources. Inter-nal money comes from your earnings, what your business or land generates. Any time you can rely on an internal source, you are likely to be better off, but there may be many occasions when money will have to come from outside the business in or-der for you to move forward.

When the money to be invested is derived from an external source, you need to be wary of any strings attached to it. Money from a bank or other lending institution has interest associated with it, and in most cases that interest is compound interest.

External money can also be derived from the government in some form of cost share or subsi-dy program. This is a source of money that com-monly becomes addictive, and its sudden with-drawal can spell financial ruin. 

Energy and Money Uses

In the second part of this check you are looking at how the energy and money will be used and whether it is appropriate in terms of your holistic context. Energy and money that are used to *build **infrastructure* \(e.g., buildings, machinery, fencing, transport, trained staff, a specific knowledge base, etc.\), or used *cyclically*, where your money grows and energy renews with no further inputs, are preferable to *consumptive* uses that have no last-ing effect. But many of your running costs, such as fuel for vehicles, or fees to your accountant, are consumptive uses and if the action passes most of the other checks it tends to pass this one. 





p.9





What you want to avoid are addictive uses of money or energy. An addictive use is one that obliges you to take the same action again and again, possibly with increasing frequency and/or increasing cost. Examples include the use of chemical fertilizers or the overuse of credit cards carrying high and compounding interest.

SUSTAINABILITY

The sustainability check asks you to consider the long-term environmental and social conse-quences of your actions relative to the future re-source base described in your holistic context. 

The question you ask is: “If we take this action will it lead toward or away from the future resource base described in our holistic context?”

This is one of the few checks that asks you to focus on a specific aspect of your holistic con-text. The future resource base describes the en-vironment and behaviors that will be essential for sustaining the quality of life you desire for yourself and your descendants. Thus the sus-tainability check assures that actions you take to meet short-term needs also provide lasting gain—that they are socially, environmentally, and economically sound in terms of the future, as well as the present.

*Your **Behavior. *No matter what type of business you are in, you need to consider how the per-ceptions of the people included in your future resource base \(clients/customers and suppliers, extended family, advisers, and so on\) are affect-ed by the actions you take. If you have described yourselves as honest, reliable, and professional, you want to make sure that the actions you take reflect this behavior.

*The **Environment.* If you are a land manager, the actions you take will generally deal with one or more of the tools covered in ebook \#3. In this 





check, you want to determine how the proposed action or tool is likely to affect the four ecosys-tem processes. Is it likely to move you toward or away from the future landscape you’ve de-scribed? If you are not a land manager then any actions you take should pass through this check if they involve the consumption of products or the use of technology because their production and use will tie back to the land and affect the functioning of the four ecosystem processes.

GUT Feel

The gut feel check is done last because it builds on the mental picture that has formed after pass-ing through all the other checks. Where each of the other questions ask what you *think* this one asks how you *feel*. And that is in large part going to be based on the values reflected in the quality of life statement embedded in your holistic con-text.

The questions you ask are: “How do we feel about this action now? Will it lead to the quality of life we desire? Will it adversely affect the lives of others?

An action may have passed all the other checks, but you may choose not to do it because it just doesn’t feel right. Or, although the action didn’t pass the majority of the checks, you still feel it’s the right thing to do right now. What is important in this latter situation is that because of what you now know, you can work to mitigate some, if not all, of the negative consequences or put a plan in place to transform them into positive outcomes.

This check also asks you to consider how an action could affect the lives of those outside your imme-diate whole—from the society you live in, to the greater society that comprises all humans. Pleas-ing everybody may seem impossible, but you can go a long way by embracing the holistic principle 





p.10





that the health of your particular interest is not dis-tinct from the health of the greater whole.

The gut feel check, more than any other, can be made only by the decision makers because it will be based on quality of life values that reflect the traditions, customs and culture you share. It would be close to impossible for anyone else to understand them as well as you do.

A LAST WORD ON THE CONTEXT CHECKS

Using the context checks might feel a little awk-ward at first, but with practice the checking will become almost second nature. At the end of this ebook is a form you can use to help you get start-ed. It also serves as a useful record you can keep on file and refer back to. 

Given time and practice, the concepts underly-ing the seven checks will become so familiar that you will automatically take them into account before planning an action. You will start to look for the underlying cause of a problem before you even begin to consider potential remedies. Be-fore you contemplate what to do about the bor-ers eating your corn, you will look for the weak link in the borer’s life cycle. Going into a prelimi-nary financial planning session, you will already have calculated the gross profit on that enter-prise you are so keen to develop.

When you’ve reached this stage, the checking really does go quickly, and it genuinely becomes nothing more than a final check to ensure the action you plan to take is sound and in line with your holistic context. 

Yet even when an action has passed all of the checks, you may later find it was the wrong thing to do. This is why monitoring your actions, and their consequences, is critical.





Monitoring your plans and actions

Monitoring is a continuous process in which you adjust your plans constantly to stay on track. Anytime you try something new that affects the environment assume you are wrong because of Nature’s inherent complexity.

Once a plan is made, monitoring becomes essen-tial because, even though the actions involved have passed all the context checks, events rarely unfold as planned. You monitor to look for devia-tions from the plan for the purpose of correcting, or controlling, them; this makes monitoring—and management—*proactive*. In far too many situa-tions we merely monitor “to see what happens,” which leads to *reactive* management.

In any situation we manage, we should be mon-itoring in order to make happen what we want to happen—to bring about desired changes in line with our holistic context. The word *plan* becomes a twenty-four-letter word: *plan-mon-**itor-control-replan*. 





p.11





PLAN

**\(Assume ****wrong\)**





Monitor





The Feedback loop





Control





Replan





All hope of reaching any goal or objective with-out great deviation or waste depends on this process:

Once a *plan* is made, it is then *monitored*. If results begin to deviate from what was planned, then control is instituted, and the deviation is brought back to plan. Sometimes events go beyond our *control*, or we fail to control the deviation, and there is a need to *replan*. The better we control the plan, the less we need to replan. 

In the Holistic Management framework, we depict this process as a loop because it is a continuous effort. Throughout the process you should be seeking indicators of change and responding to the feedback you receive, constantly adjusting your actions to stay on track. Ideally, you will shorten the loop by controlling deviations so quickly and effec-tively that there is no need to replan.

Anytime you try something new that affects the environment you should *assume **you **are **wrong* and monitor proactively, making adjustments quickly if your monitoring shows adjustments are needed. Start with a clear idea of what you want to achieve and then ask yourself, “If I am wrong, at what point could I get the earliest pos-sible indication?” That is the point you need to monitor in the simplest way you can devise.

The grazing and financial planning procedures described in ebooks \#6 through \#9 include guidelines for monitoring the plans you create, with the emphasis in each case on regular and timely monitoring and quick action to bring devi-ations back in line.





HELPFUL HINTS FOR USING THE CONTEXT CHECKS

The tendency to slip back into making deci-sions in the context of any immediate need or problem will always be with you—especial-ly in emergencies. Take actions to deal with the emergency, by all means, but check each of them to ensure they are in line with your holistic context while also dealing with the emergency.

When you are dealing with a problem, go to the cause and effect check first. If an action does not address the underlying cause of the problem, you will not solve it. 

The gross profit analysis check applies only when you are comparing two or more enter-prises; the marginal reaction check applies only when comparing two or more actions.

The weak link check applies in three different situations: social, biological, and financial.

The gut feel check is based on your feelings about the picture that emerges after passing through all the other checks that apply and should be done last.

Remember that there is no tyranny in Holistic Management, nothing that you must or must not do. You may decide to implement an action that fails one or more checks, simply because you have little option at present to do otherwise. You at least know that the decision is not in line with what you hope to achieve in the long run, and that you have to do something about it. Final-ly, even when a decision passes all the checks, it could still prove wrong. You can’t be sure un-less you monitor what you have planned and re-spond proactively to any deviations.
