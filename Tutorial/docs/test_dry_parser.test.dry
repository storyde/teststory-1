# Dry files can have lines beginning with hash for comments. Note
# that, unlike many file formats comments can only be complete lines,
# you can't comment a property (say) by putting a hash at the end of
# the value, followed by some text. In that case, the hash sign will
# be considered part of the property. A dry file is split into
# sections, each of which can begin with some properties:
title: A Title
# Properties are separated from values by a colon.
author: Ms A Uthor
# Different properties may be subject to their own syntax
# requirements.
tags: top-level, bright, silly
# Properties may not contain spaces, and have words separated by a
# hyphen.
view-if: sunny > 1
# Properties may run over multiple lines, but the second and
# successive lines must be indented. Consequently property names
# cannot be indented.
choose-if: sunny > 1 and last-rain < 2 or
   cares-about-weather = 0
# Properties are separated from content by a double blank line.

This is now content. Each section of a dry file can have unlimited
amounts of content. When the dry file is parsed, the content is
accumulated and placed into a 'content' property. For this reason,
'content' is not a valid property name.

# A new section of content is begun with an id started by an at
# symbol. The id is placed in the content's properties, so again 'id'
# is not a valid property name.
@new-id
# There should be no gap between an id and its properties, otherwise,
# the properties will be interpreted as content.
title: A New Section

This is content for the @new-id section. The top-level content doesn't
have a specific id, its id is generated from the part of the filename
before any period, so in this case, the id of the top level content is
'parse-test'. All sections are wrapped into a list in the 'sections'
property. So 'sections' is another reserved word that can't be used
for user-defined properties.

The last bit of content for dry files is an option block. They are
only required in interactive content, and are invalid in any other
context. There can be only one option block per section, and it must
be the last thing in the section, it is illegal to add more content
after an option block. The option block, if it is present is compiled
and added to a 'options' property, making 'options' another reserved
word.

# An option block:  option blocks start each line with a hyphen
- @new-id: The title of this link.
# lines starting with an at sign indicate a link to a named id, the
# text after the colon is the title that will be displayed to overrule
# the title of that section, if any.
- min: 4
# lines starting with just a hyphen declare a property, properties
# belong to the previous link.
- max: 9
- min-priority: 3
- @other-id
# lines starting with a hash indicate a tag, links corresponding to
# that tag will be added. Because this can have multiple links, titles
# aren't allowed.
- #tag
- @new-id3: This option has continuation in its title. These should be
            handled properly.

# Some more specific cases:

@no-properties

This section goes right from id to content, without a property list.

@no-content
description: This section has no content, but goes right to options.

- @no-properties: The no properties section.

@only-options

- @no-properties: This section has only options.
