This template is built on [smwhr's dendry starter pack](https://github.com/smwhr/dendry-starter-pack), with the addition of sidebars, chat like interface and custom styles. 

Another difference is that to change the game's title and author, you'll have to change line 6 of `out/html/index.html` and line 20 of `out/html/game.js`, as well as `source/info.dry`.

To see what the page looks like, see [https://aucchen.github.io/dendry_sidebar_template/](https://aucchen.github.io/dendry_sidebar_template/).

## Editing the sidebar

See `source/scenes/status.scene.dry` Everything in this scene will be displayed in the sidebar, and will be updated on every click.

## Editing the stylesheet and/or adding custom JS

See `out/html/game.css` and `out/html/game.js`.
