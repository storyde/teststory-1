Facilyn: Now let's identify the money available to you. This includes all forms of financial resources - cash, credit, investments, grants, or any other monetary assets you can access for your operations.

Facilyn: Monetary resources represent your financial capacity to implement decisions and achieve your goals. Understanding what money is available helps you make realistic plans and allocate resources effectively across your operations.
