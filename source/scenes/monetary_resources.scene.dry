title: Monetary Resources
subtitle: Money Available to You

Facilyn: Now identify the moneytary resources you have.  Whatâ€™s within reach?
 
Facilyn: This is not about a deeper conversation about the meaning of money and wealth. Just list what is in your reach.
 
This includes cash, savings, a credit you could take if needed, or crowd sourcing, etc. And it would almost always include money that could be generated from the physical assets listed in your resource base.
