subtitle: Money Available to You

Facilyn: Now let's identify the money available to you. This includes all forms of financial resources - cash, credit, investments, grants, or any other monetary assets you can access for your operations.

Facilyn: Again, you are not after a detailed financial statement, only a general understanding of your monetary resources. These might include operating budgets, emergency funds, investment capital, or revenue streams.
