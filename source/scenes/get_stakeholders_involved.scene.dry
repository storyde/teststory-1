title: Getting Everyone Involved
subtitle: Bringing Stakeholders to the Table
new-page: true

Narration: Now that we're clear about your organization's purpose, there's something crucial to understand: this framework works best when everyone who's affected by decisions is involved in creating the context.

Narration: A maintenance robot rolls by, apparently trying to fix a pothole by filling it with flower petals while playing elevator music. Someone programmed it with good intentions, but without involving the people who actually use the street.

Narration: For your organization to truly manage holistically, you need the right people at the table. Who should be involved in defining your holistic context?

[? if player_context = "school" : - @school_stakeholders: Teachers, students, parents, and community members
- @school_leadership_only: Just the school leadership and administration
- @school_teachers_only: Primarily teachers and educational staff ?]

[? if player_context = "company" : - @company_all_stakeholders: Employees, customers, suppliers, and community
- @company_management: Management and key decision-makers
- @company_workers: Workers and their representatives ?]

[? if player_context = "organization" : - @org_all_stakeholders: All affected parties and stakeholders
- @org_leadership: Organizational leadership and board
- @org_members: Members and active participants ?]

- @side_why_involve_everyone: Why involve so many people?

@community_type
title: Community Type
subtitle: Understanding Your Community Context
new-page: true

Narration: Communities vary greatly depending on their setting and character. To get the right stakeholders involved, we need to understand what kind of community you're representing.

Narration: A maintenance robot rolls by, apparently trying to deliver mail to a fire hydrant. It's been at this for hours, convinced the hydrant is a very quiet resident.

- @rural_community: A rural community (farming, small towns, countryside)
- @urban_community: An urban community (city neighborhoods, districts)
- @mixed_community: A mixed community (suburban, small cities)

@rural_stakeholders
title: Rural Community Stakeholders
subtitle: Getting Everyone to the Table
new-page: true

Narration: Rural communities have their own unique dynamics. For holistic management to work, you'll want to involve representatives from all the key groups that make up your community.

Narration: A farming drone flies overhead, apparently trying to plant seeds in the clouds. Innovation meets confusion.

Narration: Consider involving: farmers and landowners, local business owners, parents and families, youth representatives, elderly community members, local government officials, environmental stewards, and cultural/religious leaders.

- @rural_comprehensive: Include all key rural stakeholder groups
- @rural_limited: Focus on just the main decision-makers

@urban_stakeholders
title: Urban Community Stakeholders
subtitle: Representing City Diversity
new-page: true

Narration: Urban communities are incredibly diverse. Getting holistic management right means hearing from all the different voices that make up your neighborhood or district.

Narration: A street cleaning robot passes by, apparently convinced that graffiti is a form of advanced urban agriculture. It's been watering the walls for weeks.

Narration: Consider involving: residents from different backgrounds, local business owners, youth and student representatives, parents and families, elderly residents, community organization leaders, local government representatives, and advocates for different interest groups.

- @urban_comprehensive: Include diverse urban stakeholder groups
- @urban_limited: Focus on established community leaders

@urban_limited

@mixed_stakeholders
title: Mixed Community Stakeholders
subtitle: Bridging Different Worlds
new-page: true

Narration: Mixed communities often bridge rural and urban elements, creating unique opportunities and challenges. Your stakeholder group should reflect this diversity.

Narration: A delivery drone hovers uncertainly between a farm stand and a coffee shop, apparently unable to decide which represents the "real" community. Both, obviously.

Narration: Consider involving: residents from different areas (rural and urban parts), local farmers and business owners, commuters and long-time residents, parents and youth from different backgrounds, community organization leaders, and representatives of different economic interests.

- @mixed_comprehensive: Include stakeholders from all community segments
- @mixed_limited: Focus on the most vocal community members

@side_why_involve_everyone
title: Why Involve Everyone?
tags: side_conversations

Narration: Because decisions made without input from affected parties often create unintended consequences. The people doing the work know things that managers don't. The people receiving services understand needs that providers might miss.

Narration: A group of teenagers walks by, their homemade air purifier backpacks humming softly. They've solved a problem that expensive corporate solutions couldn't - because they understood their own needs.

Narration: Holistic management works best when it includes all the perspectives that matter. Otherwise, you're managing based on incomplete information.

- @back_to_stakeholders: I see. Let me choose who to involve.
