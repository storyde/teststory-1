Good. What feels like the right scope for your 'whole under management'?"

- @choose_individual: "Myself and my personal impact."
- @choose_household: "My household and immediate environment."
- @choose_organization: "My organization and its stakeholders."
- @choose_community: "My local community."
- @choose_network: "My extended network of relationships."
- @choose_region: "My region or larger geographic area."
- @choose_multiple: "Multiple interconnected scopes."

Take a moment to really think about this. Where do you have actual decision-making power? What resources do you control or influence? Who asks for your input?


Sarah: "Excellent. Now you're clear about what you're actually managing. That's the foundation for everything else."

She makes notes in her worn notebook.
