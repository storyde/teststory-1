Narration: The **Gross Profit Analysis** check helps you select enterprises that best cover overhead costs.

Narration: The question you ask is: **"Which enterprises contribute the most to covering the overheads of the business?"**

Narration: Gross profit = Income from enterprise - Additional costs you wouldn't have without that enterprise. The enterprise with the highest gross profit helps cover your fixed costs (rent, insurance, basic utilities) most effectively.

Narration: A financial analysis robot nearby is calculating the profitability of selling individual grains of sand. Its precision is impressive, though its business model needs work.
