title: Human Resources
subtitle: People with influence on management decisions

Facilyn: Now make a list of the categories of people who can/will influence or be influenced by the management decisions you make, but won't have the power to veto or alter them.

[? if sector = "policymaking" : 

Facilyn: If your organisation is involved in governing and policymaking for your community, your city, for your country or even on an international level, you need to make sure to invite citizens from various backgrounds. Otherwise, you risk that your context, that we are about to create in a minute, reflects only the priorities of your organisation or of the institutions you collaborate with, instead of reflecting the interests of the people you govern.
?]

Facilyn: These people are no less important than the decision makers. In fact, they are often vitally important to your whole even though they do not make management decisions within it. You wouldn't be in business without the clients or customers who buy your products, for instance.
