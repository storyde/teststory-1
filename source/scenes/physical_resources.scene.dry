title: Physical Resources
subtitle: Major Physical Assets Available to You

Facilyn: Now let's identify the major physical resources from which you can generate revenue or derive support. These might include land, buildings, equipment, machinery, or other physical assets. These resources need not be owned, merely available to you.

Facilyn: You are not after a detailed list of every asset you have, only a very general one. You may later decide to sell some of the assets you own anyway, particularly the liquid or movable ones.

Me: Why Identify Physical Resources?

Facilyn: Physical resources form the foundation of your operations. They represent your capacity to deliver services, produce goods, or create value. Understanding what physical assets are available helps you make better management decisions about how to use them effectively.

A maintenance robot rolls by, apparently cataloguing every physical object in sight, including a confused pigeon that it's trying to classify as "mobile infrastructure."
