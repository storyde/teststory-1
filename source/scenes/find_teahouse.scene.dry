You step into a wide plaza.

Info screens alternate with small shops. 
A delivery drone circles overhead, searching for the best angle to take a selfie.  

On the horizon, a dust storm gathers, its grit already scratching at your throat.

Nearby, someone mutters something about the polycrisis...

Me: The poly-what?  

The stranger eyes you, amused.  

Stranger: The polycrisis is when social, economic, and environmental challenges stop lining up one by one... and start crashing down together.

Me: Hey, before you go, could you tell me how to get to the teahouse?

Stranger: Sure, it's that way. Just follow the red banners; they'll lead you straight there.

They point to a sidestreet, then disappear into the crowd.

You step closer to one of the info-screens. Images flicker: last week’s megafires, famine zones, heatwaves, and protests.

The headlines warn:  

Headline1: Protests escalate.
Headline1: Blackouts expected to continue.
Headline2: Global harvests at record low.  
Headline3: Water shortages intensifying.

A vendor waves a cracked purifier bottle at you.  

Vendor: One sip for a coin. Or keep walking thirsty.  

- @pay_vendor: Hand over your last crypto  
- @haggle_vendor: Haggle with the vendor.

subtitle: Last coin spent  

You hand over your last bit of crypto. The water tastes metallic, but eases your throat.

Me: That’s robbery. Half a coin.  

The vendor narrows his eyes, then shrugs.  
Vendor: Fine. Half. You’ll wish you’d bought more.  

The water is thin but cool. Enough to ease your tongue.

The vendor points down a side street.  

Vendor: Follow the red banners. You can’t miss it.

You see some people with their kids scratching shapes into the dust.  
As you get closer, you recognize the logos of NASA, WHO, WWF and other organizations.

Me: Why do you draw these?  
Drawer: So we remember who tries to fix what, even if it doesn’t last.  

The dust from the nearby farms blows the drawings away. 

It’s a quiet reminder: Without functioning agriculture, most organizations would not even exist.

You stumble through the side street, dust stinging your face. 

On the sidewalk, a drone hovers in place, dropping crumbs to a swarm of eager pigeons. Then it falters, topples, and lies struggling on the ground.

The paper lanterns of the old teahouse sway in the wind, welcoming you into dim light.

You crouch and carefully pick it up.  

Me: Let’s see... sensors misaligned.  

You switch off the drone, adjust its optics, check the battery and switch it back on again.  

The drone lifts off, circling briefly before palling again with the birds. 

Something about its behavior makes you smile...
