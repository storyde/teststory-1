Narration: Now that you have your complete holistic context, it's time to put it to work. You'll face a series of real-world scenarios where you can practice applying your framework to make decisions that align with your values and goals.

Narration: A decision-making robot sits nearby, apparently trying to choose between two identical pebbles by conducting extensive cost-benefit analyses on each one. It's been at this for three hours, demonstrating the importance of having a clear framework for decisions.

Narration: Each scenario will present you with a problem or opportunity, and you'll use your holistic context and the seven context checks to evaluate your options.

@scenario_community_energy
title: Community Energy Crisis
subtitle: Applying the Framework to Infrastructure Decisions
new-page: true

Narration: Your community is facing rolling blackouts due to an aging power grid. Three solutions have been proposed, and the community council has asked for your input based on your holistic management expertise.

Narration: **Option A**: Install a coal-fired backup generator - cheap, reliable, but polluting
**Option B**: Invest in solar panels with battery storage - expensive upfront, clean long-term
**Option C**: Implement energy conservation measures first - moderate cost, reduces demand

Narration: Let's apply your holistic context to evaluate these options:

- @energy_cause_effect: Apply Cause and Effect check
- @energy_sustainability: Apply Sustainability check
- @energy_gut_feel: Apply Gut Feel check
- @energy_make_decision: Make your recommendation

@energy_cause_effect
title: Cause and Effect Analysis
subtitle: Addressing Root Causes

Narration: **Question**: Does this action address the root cause of the problem?

Narration: The immediate problem is insufficient power generation, but what's the root cause? Is it inadequate generation capacity, or excessive demand, or inefficient distribution?

Narration: **Option A (Coal)**: Addresses insufficient capacity but not efficiency or demand
**Option B (Solar)**: Addresses capacity with clean generation
**Option C (Conservation)**: Addresses excessive demand directly

Narration: Which option best addresses the root cause in your view?

- @energy_sustainability: Continue to Sustainability check

@energy_sustainability
title: Sustainability Analysis
subtitle: Long-term Consequences

Narration: **Question**: Will this action lead toward or away from the future resource base described in your holistic context?

[? if condition_climate = 1 : Narration: You identified stable climate as essential for your future. How does each option affect climate? ?]
[? if condition_water = 1 : Narration: You identified clean water systems as essential. How does each option affect water resources? ?]
[? if condition_soil = 1 : Narration: You identified regenerating soil as essential. How does each option affect land use? ?]

Narration: **Option A (Coal)**: Contributes to climate change, air pollution
**Option B (Solar)**: Supports clean energy transition, minimal environmental impact
**Option C (Conservation)**: Reduces overall environmental pressure

- @energy_gut_feel: Continue to Gut Feel check
- @energy_make_decision: Make your recommendation based on analysis so far

@energy_gut_feel
title: Gut Feel Assessment
subtitle: Values-Based Decision

Narration: **Question**: How do you feel about this action? Will it lead to the quality of life you desire?

[? if qol_health = 1 : Narration: You want good health and vitality. Which option best supports community health? ?]
[? if qol_security = 1 : Narration: You want security and stability. Which option provides the most reliable long-term security? ?]
[? if qol_community = 1 : Narration: You want strong community connections. Which option brings the community together? ?]

Narration: Consider not just the technical aspects, but how each choice aligns with the life you want to create.

- @energy_make_decision: Make your recommendation

@energy_make_decision
title: Your Recommendation
subtitle: Holistic Decision Making

Narration: Based on your analysis using the holistic management framework, what do you recommend to the community council?

- @recommend_conservation: Recommend starting with conservation measures
- @recommend_solar: Recommend investing in solar and storage
- @recommend_combined: Recommend a phased approach combining conservation and solar
- @recommend_coal: Recommend the coal backup generator

@recommend_conservation
on-arrival: decision_conservation = 1

Narration: You recommend focusing on conservation first. This addresses the root cause (excessive demand), aligns with sustainability goals, and builds community cooperation around shared resource management.

Narration: The council appreciates your systematic analysis and decides to implement a community-wide conservation program before considering generation options.

- @scenario_results: See the results of your decision
- @return_to_scenarios: Try another scenario

@recommend_solar
on-arrival: decision_solar = 1

Narration: You recommend the solar investment despite the higher upfront cost. Your analysis showed it best aligns with long-term sustainability and the quality of life you want to create.

Narration: The council is impressed by your long-term thinking and decides to explore financing options for the solar project.

- @scenario_results: See the results of your decision
- @return_to_scenarios: Try another scenario

@recommend_combined
on-arrival: decision_combined = 1

Narration: You recommend a phased approach: start with conservation to reduce immediate demand, then invest in solar for long-term sustainability. This addresses both root causes and long-term goals.

Narration: The council loves the comprehensive approach and votes to implement both phases.

- @scenario_results: See the results of your decision
- @return_to_scenarios: Try another scenario

@recommend_coal
on-arrival: decision_coal = 1

Narration: You recommend the coal generator for immediate reliability, acknowledging it doesn't align perfectly with long-term sustainability but addresses the urgent need.

Narration: The council appreciates your honest assessment of the trade-offs involved.

- @scenario_results: See the results of your decision
- @return_to_scenarios: Try another scenario

@scenario_results
title: Decision Outcomes
subtitle: Learning from Application

Narration: Six months later, you can see the results of applying holistic management principles to real decisions:

[? if decision_conservation = 1 : Narration: The conservation program reduced energy demand by 30%, eliminating most blackouts. Community cooperation increased as people worked together toward a shared goal. ?]

[? if decision_solar = 1 : Narration: The solar project took time to implement, but the community now has clean, reliable energy. Property values increased and the community became a model for others. ?]

[? if decision_combined = 1 : Narration: The phased approach worked perfectly. Conservation provided immediate relief while solar installation proceeded. The community now has both reduced demand and clean generation. ?]

[? if decision_coal = 1 : Narration: The coal generator solved the immediate problem but created new issues with air quality and community division over environmental concerns. ?]

Narration: This demonstrates how using your holistic context as a decision-making framework leads to outcomes that align with your deeper values and long-term goals.

Narration: Now that you've experienced applying your holistic context to real decisions, you might be interested in learning about the formal context checks that can help you evaluate any decision systematically.
