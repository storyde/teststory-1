Facilyn: The Statement of Purpose is a description of what your organization is truly here to accomplish.

Facilyn: For example, a hospital's purpose isn't "To make money from sick people" - it's "To heal and restore health." 

Facilyn: A good Statement of Purpose captures the positive change your organization creates in the world. It's the "why" behind everything you do.

Facilyn: Even a factory's purpose isn't just "To make things" - it might be "To create tools that improve people's lives" or "To transform raw materials into useful products."

Facilyn: So, which purpose do you think fits your organisation best?
