Me: I am not sure what a Statement of Purpose is.

Facilyn: A Statement of Purpose captures the positive change your organisation creates. It's the "why" behind everything you do.

Facilyn: For example, a hospital's purpose isn't "To make money from sick people" - instead, it can be described like this: "To heal and restore health."

Facilyn: A factory's purpose isn't just "To make things" - it might be "To create tools that improve people's lives" or "To transform raw materials into useful products."

Facilyn: Which purpose fits your organisation best?
