Narration: The first context check is **Cause and Effect**. This check is essential when you're trying to solve a problem.

Narration: The question you ask is: **"Does this action address the root cause of the problem?"**

Narration: A maintenance robot nearby is spraying pesticide on cockroaches while completely ignoring the pile of food scraps that attracted them in the first place. Classic symptom treatment instead of cause addressing.

Narration: This check helps you avoid quick fixes that only suppress symptoms. If the problem keeps returning, you probably haven't addressed the real cause.

- @ce_complete: I understand this check
