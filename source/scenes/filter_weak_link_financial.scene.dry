Narration: The **Financial Weak Link** check helps you identify where to invest limited resources for maximum impact on income.

Narration: The question you ask is: **"Does this action strengthen the weakest link in the chain of production?"**

Narration: Your chain of production has three links: **Resource Conversion** (raw materials to products), **Product Conversion** (refining for market), and **Marketing** (products to money).

Narration: A business optimization robot nearby is polishing an already perfect product while completely ignoring the fact that nobody knows the product exists. Classic strong-link investment instead of weak-link focus.

Narration: Like any chain, your business is only as strong as its weakest link. Investing in already-strong links won't improve overall performance.
