Narration: The **Sustainability** check considers long-term environmental and social consequences.

Narration: The question you ask is: **"If we take this action, will it lead toward or away from the future resource base described in our holistic context?"**

Narration: This ensures your short-term actions support your long-term vision.

Narration: A planning robot nearby is optimizing today's efficiency by burning tomorrow's resources. It's achieving excellent short-term metrics while undermining long-term sustainability.
