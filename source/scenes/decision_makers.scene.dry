Facilyn: Now that we're clear about your organization's purpose, there's something crucial to understand: this framework works best when everyone who's making decisions in your entity is involved in this conversation.

Facilyn: Let's make sure we have the right people at the table. In you organisation, who is making decisions, who is expected to carry out these decisions, and are there any other people with veto power over your decisions? Try to be inclusive rather than exclusive.

Me: Why Involve Everyone?

Facilyn: To leave out affected parties often creates unintended consequences. You risk that the context you will create becomes one-sided or meaningless to people who were not involved in this process. 

In front of the teahouse, a post robot rolls by, apparently trying to deliver mail to a fire hydrant. It's been at this for hours, convinced the hydrant is a very quiet resident.
