Narration: Excellent choice. By involving all key stakeholders, you're building the foundation for decisions that everyone can understand and support.

Narration: This process will take more time and effort upfront, but it creates much stronger results. When people help create the context, they're invested in making it work.

Narration: For now, let's proceed with you representing this broader group, but remember that in real implementation, you'd want to facilitate this process with everyone present.

Narration: Facilitating holistic context creation with a large group requires patience and skill. You'd typically work through each question together, allowing different perspectives to emerge and finding common ground.

Narration: The key is helping people see beyond their individual roles to the larger whole they're all part of. A teacher, student, and parent might have different immediate concerns, but they all want education that truly serves young people.

Narration: It's about finding the shared vision that everyone can commit to, even if they contribute to it in different ways.

- @back_to_commitment: I understand. Let's proceed.
